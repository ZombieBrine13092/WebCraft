This branch contains the files required to run a WebCraft server.
Your server should be forwarded on port 3000 if necessary.

Run this node command in the folder where server.js is located:
node server.js

To install dependencies, run the included batch installer.

You can modify this file however you see fit for your server.
The server requires literally less than 50 MB of memory and a CPU made in at least the last 11 years.
